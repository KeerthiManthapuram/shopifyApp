# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# E-Commerce Products Listing App:
This is a fully functional e-commerce application built using React.js and Redux. The application demonstrates a modern and user-friendly interface for product listing and user management. It includes essential features like authentication, product filtering, and a shopping cart, making it a great showcase of MERN stack capabilities.

Features
1. Authentication with Redux Thunk
Users must log in using the provided credentials:
            Username: jimmie_k
            Email: jimmie@gmail.com
The login functionality is implemented using Redux Thunk, ensuring secure and efficient authentication flow.
A logout button is provided in the header for seamless session management.

2. Home Page
Search Bar: Enables users to quickly search for products by name.
Filters:
Filter products by category.
Sort products by price, with options to display items from low to high or high to low.
The dynamic interface ensures an intuitive shopping experience.

3. Product Details Page
Clicking on any product card redirects the user to the Product Details View.
This page displays detailed information about the selected product, including:
Product name, description, price, and other relevant details.
A button allows users to add the product to their cart.

4. Cart Page
Displays all the products that the user has added to their cart.
The cart view provides a clear summary of the selected items, enhancing the shopping experience.

5. User Page
Displays the logged-in user's details.

Technologies Used
React.js: For building the user interface.
Redux: For managing global state across the application.
Redux Thunk: For handling asynchronous actions such as user authentication.
CSS: For styling the application with a clean and modern design.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
